# Local development artifacts
# *.log # If logs are not meant to be part of the image, but api_hits.log is used by FileHandler
# For api_hits.log, if it's created inside the container, it's fine.
# If it's part of the build context and shouldn't be, then add it.
# Assuming api_hits.log is runtime, so not ignoring it here.

# Model paths - only if models are downloaded/mounted and not part of build context
# model_paths/ # For now, assuming models are copied if in build context.

# Prometheus specific if downloaded locally and not part of app
# prometheus.yml # This is likely a config file for prometheus itself, not the app.
                 # If it's copied into the app image for some reason, decide if it should be.
                 # For now, assuming it's external to the app image.
